USFM to Simple HTML Converter Using PHP

This is based on a project initiated by Rusmin Soetjipto for MediaWiki 
and ported to DokuWiki by Yvonne Lu
[[GitHub Project]](https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/Dokuwiki-USFMTag).

It is designed to operate outside of any framework, and to produce simple html that can be
styled with CSS. Included in this repository is the file containing all three php classes and
a sample style sheet.
